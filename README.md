wow. READMEs are turning into my coding journals... thanks Github for all the storage space. 
Back to the office tomorrow but still racing against the clock with determination stronger than ever that I will finish these Android basics.

Set the layout for the app today and pretty excited because 
1. finally able to spell constraint and the corresponding line of code correctly without having to copy and paste
2. set radio buttons and radio group ... interesting because I was just revising it yesterday / these few days in HTML dejavu?

I'd like to conclude rebel status achieved 😂 I didn't sleep well last night as per usual 
instead I somehow got gutsy enough to open android studio in another while at work
THEN. even after a day's work, on my way home I did some coding on the bus but it didn't workout cause I was just too exhausted and hence me redoing them after dinner.

BACK TO KOTLIN - there remains a question 🙋‍♀️ when do I use R.id and when do I use binding?
